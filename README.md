# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Purpose

Using R to perform an analysis of Auto R Us' production data to determine areas of improvement and make Auto R Us stand out amoung its competition.  

## Deliverable #1 

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The vehicle length and the spoiler angle.  

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value is 5.35e-11.  

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Yes, the linear model predicts the mph of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the multiple R-squared is 0.7149.

## Deliverable #2

### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

#### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

Yes, the current manufactoring data does meet this design specification. All the Variances in the lots are well below 100 pounds per square inch.

## Deliverable #3

Lot one slightly differes from lot 2 and lot 3.  Lot 1 has a p-value of 1 while lot 2 and 3 has lower p-values.  see screenshot below.

## Deliverable #4

### Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

As an auto designer company, Auto R Us must compare their performance with their competiters.  First they nust compare the pricing with their competition and then compare the values of that pricing such as mileage, design, power, etc.
